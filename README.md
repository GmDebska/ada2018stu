# Advanced Data Analytics 2018 Spring

Files are organised in weeks. E.g. W0/ contains materials for the preparation week. W1/ contains Jupyter notebooks, and related documents for study in Week 1. 

* Install Anaconda following instructions on its [download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). I worked all examples on Python 3.5, since 3.6 got issue with pytorch back in Dec 2017. But I believe Python 3.6 should be fine now (July 2018) for all packages, at least on Mac and Linux. Refer to solutions like [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50185227/problems-installing-and-importing-pytorch) if you encounter version problems.
* Install pytorch by 
```
  conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```
* Install scikit-learn by
```
  conda install scikit-learn
```
